# Audio-responsive-wallpaper
A wallpaper engine project that visualizes audio and adds more shenanigans to the mix.

In the wallpaper you can control the audio bar's properties, adjust particles that pop in and out of the screen, add background image, and much more!

The wallpaper is designed to work on an application named 'Wallpaper Engine', which is a software that lets you use a live wallpaper.

If you would like to contribute to the project, you can find me on steam, My username is Pazox.
